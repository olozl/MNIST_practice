Description
These programs are to classify the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset using different approaches.
0. dataset/  Dictionary of MNIST dataset
1. linear.py Created a perceptron with one layer of 10 softmax neurons. 
             By changing learning rate, I observed that the smaller learning rate is the smoother the accuracy graph is shown with of course less oscillations. Also, the experiments with smaller learning rate run slower than ones with larger learning rate since it took small steps in adjusting the weights.
